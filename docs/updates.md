## April 2025 Updates

### Chat History Persistence

**Date:** April 2, 2025

We've implemented chat history persistence in the latest update. Your chat conversations will now be saved to your browser's local storage, ensuring they remain available even when you:

- Refresh the page
- Navigate to another page and return
- Close and reopen your browser

This feature uses your browser's localStorage to save messages, tied to a unique conversation ID, so your chat history remains private to your device.

#### Technical Details

The implementation:

- Saves messages to localStorage whenever they change
- Loads messages from localStorage when the chat component initializes 
- Uses a unique conversationId as the storage key
- Maintains the "Clear chat" functionality to allow users to reset their history

### Additional Improvements

- **Performance Enhancements**: Backend optimizations for faster response times
- **UI Refinements**: Subtle improvements to the chat interface
- **Mobile Experience**: Better responsiveness on smaller screens
